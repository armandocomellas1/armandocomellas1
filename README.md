- üëã Hello, my name is Armando, and l am a software developer that applies the last and best practices with the new and most common used technologies such as javascript ES5 and ES6, Html5, CSS, bootstrap as a framework, scss compiler, webpack for modulating the web app and I'm still learning more of them thanks by microverse software development school, in my previous work l have been for 3 years in a NetSuite solution ERP provider working with ES5 and the framework of Netsuite, my work had an impact with a new customer signed contract inside the company ‚ÄúKeep it simple‚Äù, I know how to work in big dev teams and also I am quick learning person in new processes when l get into a new job.

I can say just one thing about this career, l love it! and that makes me give everything to achieve my goals, in general l have 10 years of experience working but in other fields, such as administrative, as a software developer my experience has started 3 years ago, microverse Bootcamp has helped me out so much to boost my hidden skills, with that means, l feel more comfortable when people talk with more tech concepts and working with Git-flow and applying best coding practices reducing in a big amount the time of developing whatever it comes to the table.

I have a personal quote it says: ‚ÄúI expect to return the same value as the same value l will give to the company‚Äù so l know that adding a point of aggregation value is important for any company or organization because everything is about cost-benefit.
